Wears glasses to look more mature 
Got fired for vomiting at work
Dated their friend's parent
Got stuck in an escalator 
Spends 30 minutes a day looking at themselves in the mirror
Still sleeps with their teddy
Thinks the R on the gearbox means race mode
Their toes are deformed
Thinks the earth is flat 
Sets the volume to an odd number
Puts milk before cereals
Makes Chucky doll nightmares
Always wears socks with sandals
Went to their father's funeral in crocs
Climbs the window because the door is boring
Washes the floor with a toothbrush
Is a big fan of Teletubies
Calls themselves homosexual to dump their partner
Eats their boogers
Peed in a bottle and pretended it was apple juice
Has tattoed a picture of their dog on their shoulder
Won a contest for the biggest hot dog eater
Wears shorts everyday even in winter
Has ice cream for breakfast
Loves insects for snacks
Has a secret hiding place under their bed for chocolates
Hates kids because they smell
Volunteers for an animal association
Is so stingy that they shower at the swimming pool only once a week
Won a marathon
Is scared of Tupperwares
Plays air guitar every sunday at church
Thinks Bryan is really in the kitchen
Has a cow pet in their house
Still has their mum read them bedtime stories
Wears christmas socks everyday
Uses pet shampoo because it makes their hair sliky
Thinks fishes are rectangular because of breaded fish
Can quote every line of The Lord of the ring
Sucks their thumb
Collects road studs
Reads the dictionnary before they are going to sleep
Thinks they are immortal
Is still afraid of the monster under their bed
Had surgery to look like their idol
Thinks their house is haunted
Thinks they are a chef when the only dish they know how to cook is overcooked pasta
Only eats liquid food because has no teeth
Painted all their walls black
Eats from cans because is too lazy to clean the dishes
Goes to the lake to wash their clothes because doesn't own a washing machine
Climbs trees everytime they get drunk
Only has tatoos of their cat from every angle
Has a shrimp tattoo on the right ankle
Electrocuted themselves while trying to replace a light bulb
Eats cheese with chocolate
Used to be a member of a sect
Thinks walruses speak in Morse code 
Only goes to the movie to eat some popcorn
Run backward to try to go back in time
Eats leaves from the trees because they taste like green beans 
Stopped drinking coronas due to coronavirus 
Dreams about the English teacher every night
Their hobby is to measure things
Tried to do a heist with a Nerf
Thinks they can do witchcraft since they watched Harry Potter
Never been to the dentist 
Already swam in the footbath
Learn the bagpipe to wake up his neighbors
Listens to ASMR before going to bed
Lives with an inflatable doll
Takes the roundabouts the wrong way 
Thinks a zebra is just a striped horse
Already tried to juggle a bowling ball
Thinks Bolivia is a brand of tea
Has been a royalist since the childhood
Never finishes their  ...
Confuses green olives with black ones
Thinks Internet Explorer is the future 
Burns ants to gain manhood 
Go to class only to flirt
Adept of sweet butter
Sells dirty underwear online
Knows how to use the indicators of his car
